		Data Driven Testing:[data should be derived from an external resource by using 3rd part tool and run the testscripts is called ]

# you should not hardcode the url in the test scripts because running the test scripts in diffenent environment is difficult
# you should not hardcoded the browser name in the test scripts, since selenium supports multiple  platforms and browsers it is difficut
	execute the same test scripots in different os and browsers

#2 types of data 1)common data [common for each and every testscripts e.g. browser, url, username, password... (usely stored in property file, jsonfile, or dirctly derived from command line ) ]
		 2)testscript data[specific to each test scripts (usely derived from xlsheet, database..)

we should not hardcode common data and testscript data in testscripts

#advantages of implimenting datadriven testing
1]modification of test data is easy
2]maintainence os testdata id easy
3]running the test scripts in different environments is easy
