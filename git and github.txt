				git and github

what is git:git
	 git is version control system

why do we need vcs:[different vcs are git,subversion, mercurial..]
1)if your computer crashes
2)if 2 or more people need to contribute on same code
3)difficult to track changes and revert back to previous versions is difficult

why git is far best than other vcs:
	1]git is distributede version control system means version histories are maintained on both local and as well as cloud
	2]we can host our code by using github (it is a website allows you to store your code in cloud) which is powered by git

git commands:

#create new github repo
#push code to this repo using git
#git commands:
	1)git clone url => clones the cloud_repo to your local_repo
	2)git status => shows the changes in the repo 
	1)git add fileName => will add the file to staging area, later staging area is used to commit files
	2)git commit => will adds your changes to local version controll database.still not pushed to remote server
	5)git log => will logs the commit history with commit id each
	3)git push => will push the commited changes to remote repo
	4)git difftool => shows the local changes and previous versions
